I'm trying to build a website to help people locate and buy cars easily

Homepage
The homepage of the site will have a listing of cars which will be a grid with lets say 4 columns on desktop and 1 column on mobile
Each grid is a car card which contain data about the car
The Car card will have data like
*Image of the card
*Name of the Car
*The speed
and other relevant stats
